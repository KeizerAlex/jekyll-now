<P>Don found one of the videos they showed at the last PDC: <A href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2005/10/22/15791.aspx">link</A></P>
<P>Although the video is (supposed to be) funny, it also has a more serious undertone: developers should be aware of the "pain" that they are causing, in order to prevent them from making the same mistakes over and over again.</P>
<P>Update: <A href="http://www.updatexp.com/we-share-your-pain.html">new link</A></P>
