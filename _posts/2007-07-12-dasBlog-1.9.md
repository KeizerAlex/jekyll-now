<P>I just finished the upgrade to das Blog 1.9.7174.0. This version has more support for reducing comment-spam. (See <A href="http://www.dasblog.info/">http://www.dasblog.info/</A>Â for other changes)<BR>Browsing thru the old posts revealed a large number of 'contributions' from China and the Middle East. For some reason deleting comments from a post that has more than 4 comments takes quite some time. The amount of time increases exponentially with the number of comments. Not sure what causes this.<BR>Luckily v1.9 allows me to prevent comments on posts older than 60 days, so cleaning old posts shouldn't be necessary after this.</P>
<P>One of the 'benefits' of removing comment spam is that it did demonstrate that Vista displays all of those non-western character sets. So we're one step closer in actually understanding what they are trying to sell.</P>
