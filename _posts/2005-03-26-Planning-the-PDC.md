<P>The next PDC is starting to get more attention; one of the things being <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jmazner/archive/2005/03/24/401894.aspx">discussed</A> is the planning and how to prevent sessions from being overfilled.</P>
<P>There are a number of ways to prevent overfilling:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Drastically reduce the number of attendees and do this in such a way that the number of attendees approaches the number of seats in one of the smaller rooms.<BR>
<LI>Have everyone sign up for the specific sessions they want to attend and (try to ;-))Â control access to the rooms</LI></UL>
<P>Neither of the options seem viable. I attended the last PDC and although it got a little crowded at certain sessions, I think they did a great job. Getting thousands of people to move around from session to session must be a logistical nightmare.</P>
