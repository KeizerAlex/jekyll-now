<P>How long would it take for the /.-mobs to find Robert's blog? <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rmclaws/archive/2005/01/08/349242.aspx">http://weblogs.asp.net/rmclaws/archive/2005/01/08/349242.aspx</A></P>
<P>One of quotes he didn't mention, is actually the reverse of the argument that is often used to explain why Microsoft products receive so much 'attention' from hackers:</P>

<P><EM>"I think it's unlikely that we'll see hackers rush to exploit this vulnerability," Emm said. "After all, Firefox has a much, much smaller install base than IE, and it's likely that hackers will continue to pay more attention to (IE) instead."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Somehow I don't expect an agreement on what the best/safest/fastest browser is, will happen anytime soon. </P>
