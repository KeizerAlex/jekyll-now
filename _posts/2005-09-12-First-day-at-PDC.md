Yesterday I attended the first pre-conference session ".NET 2.0 / Smart Client perspective" by Rocky Lhotka and Billy 'Windas" Hollis. Most of the stuff they discussed wasn't new, but it was nice to hear about the choices and tradeoffs that have to be made when implementing Smart Clients. You can also hear Billy speak about SC on DNR: <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showID=92">http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showID=92</a>

Afterwards I dropped by the AMD/Alienware game-room; the game played there was Tekken (64 bits):  ![]({{ "/images/PDC_Games1.JPG" | absolute_url }})
