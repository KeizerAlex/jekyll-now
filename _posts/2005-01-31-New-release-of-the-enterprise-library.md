<P>Just recently we've been looking into using one or more of the code blocks that are available from Patterns and Practices. Because of the work that was needed to integrate the different blocks, we decided to wait for the new release of the enterprise library. I just received an email from Pascal with the news that MSDN Patterns and practices just released the new/public version of the Enterprise Library; quite a bit sooner than we had expected.</P>
<P>This release should integrate the following blocks: “Caching Application Block, Configuration Application Block, Cryptography Application Block, Data Access Application Block, Exception Handling Application Block, Logging & Instrumentation Application Block, and Security Application Block“. </P>
<P>Download can be found <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=0325B97A-9534-4349-8038-D56B38EC394C&displaylang=en">here</A>.</P>
