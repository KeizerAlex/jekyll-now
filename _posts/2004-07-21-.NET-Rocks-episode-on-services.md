<P><A href="http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/PermaLink.aspx?guid=df15d983-cb2f-412d-8efc-83f1447b0a83">Clemens </A>is a guest on the latest episode of <A href="http://www.franklins.net/dotnetrocks/">.NET Rocks</A>. There is a discussion (or should I say monologue?) on service-orientation and the mindshift that this entails.</P>
<P>The biggest challenge in getting this to work within an large organization, will not be of aÂ technical nature. The current 'owners' of large applications would have to cooperate with the 'owners' of other applications or departments and share functionality. Getting people to get along is always harder than solving technical issues.</P>
