<P>Apple just announced new versions of the iMac and Powerbook that run on x86 instead of the usual PPC-chips. The call for having MacOs run on non-Apple systems will only become louder. Would it now also work the other way around: buy a Powerbook and be able to install Windows XP? </P>
<P>It has to be said that Apple makes great looking hardware; it would be great to be able to run Visual Studio on it.</P>
