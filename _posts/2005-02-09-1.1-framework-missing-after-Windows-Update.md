title: 1.1 framework missing after Windows Update

<P>After running the latest batch of updates, I got the following error when trying to open a webapp from Visual Studio: ASP.NET version mismatch ({{ "/images/errorafterupdate.png" | absolute_url }})</P>
<P>Although “aspnet_regiis -lv” reports that framework 1.1 is installed on the webserver, running “aspnet_regiis -i” seems to fix the problem.</P>
