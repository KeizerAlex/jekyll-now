<P>Microsoft is teasing us about <A href="http://www.origamiproject.com/1/">Origami</A>. </P>
<P>If you don't want to wait until march 2nd, check out <A href="http://kevintwodotoh.com/2006/02/25/hardware/origami-video-the-real-deal.html">this post</A>. Seems like the marketing guys were a bit to eager and didn't wait with adding the video to their portfolio. We can't be sure that this is the actual product, but it does look very cool.</P>
<P>Update: the movie was removed from the site, which only adds to the credibility of the story.<BR>2nd update: mirror at <A href="http://www.youtube.com/?v=jwQJZe0KL9U">http://www.youtube.com/?v=jwQJZe0KL9U</A></P>
