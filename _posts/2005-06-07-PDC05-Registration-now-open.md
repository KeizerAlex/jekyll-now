<P>The registration for the '05 PDC has opened; there are also more details on the different tracks and sessions that will be available. If PDC03 is anything to go by, it'll difficult to choose the sessions to attend and which sessions to skip. Avalon, metro, IIS7, Monad, C# 3.0, SQL 2005 ... one thing is certain:</P><P<A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc/pdcfriends.aspx"><A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc/pdcfriends.aspx"><IMG src="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc/Flairs/PDC05Flair_74847.jpg" border=0></A> </A>
