<P>Although the last couple of weeks have been quite busy, I've managed to get everything organized for attending the PDC. No more 'work' for the next week and a half. :-)</P>
<P>I've even managed to install the Windows Vista and VS2005 betas on my laptop; this combined with the stuff they'll be showing off at the PDC should make for a very interesting week.</P>
<P>I haven't had much time to play with Vista but one thingÂ I can say is that the user-experience on a dedicated machine is very different from a VPC-installation. I actually bought a different harddrive to install it; this way I'm certain nothing bad will happen to my 'production' machine/install.</P>
