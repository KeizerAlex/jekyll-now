<P>At <A href="http://www.groktalk.net/blog/">http://www.groktalk.net/blog/</A> you'll find a few dozen <A href="http://mediaserver.aspsoft.com/blog/JustWhatIsAGrokTalk.aspx">groktalks</A>. I have watched a few sofar. Because they're 10 minutes or less, it is easy to 'browse' the different subjects that are covered. These range from AJAX in ASP.NET 2.0 to recompling stored procs in SQL Server. I recommend looking the one by <A href="http://mediaserver.aspsoft.com/blog/JackieGoldsteinPresentingRapidWinformsDesignAndDataBinding.aspx">Jackie Goldstein</A> on Winforms and databinding.</P>
