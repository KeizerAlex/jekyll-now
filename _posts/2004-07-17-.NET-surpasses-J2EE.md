<P>The ServerSide.NET is <A href="http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=27358">quoting</A> a report on the number of developers that are using .NET vs. the number using J2EE. Although it is nice to see that so many are using .NET, this kind of headline is usually the start of a flame-war between the two groups of supporters.</P>
<P>More attention should be given to increasing the ease of interoperability between the two platforms. The easier this gets, the better the chances are that everybody is able to use the technology that they find to be the most productive. The amount of effort that is now being put into convincing people that the technology that they use is wrong, can then be used to create a better solution for the end-user.</P>
