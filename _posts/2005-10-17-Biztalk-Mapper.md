<P>Have you done more than trivial mapping using the Biztalk Mapper? Check out the (second) video on Channel 9 featuring Eddie Churchill. In this <A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=126990">video</A> he's showing off the stuff he demoed during his session at PDC. Productivity goes up another notch.</P>
<P>The only question left to ask is "When?"</P>
