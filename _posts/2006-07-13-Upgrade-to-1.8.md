<P>I just upgraded to <A href="http://www.dasblog.info/">dasBlog</A> 1.8. The main reason was that the texteditor (ftb) in version 1.7 didn't work with IE7.</P>
<P>For those looking to upgrade to 1.8: the page editentry.aspx produces an error when you use IIS on Vista. The error I got was:</P><PRE>   "System.ArgumentException: Item has already been added. <BR>   Key in dictionary: 'ꆈꌠꁱꂷ (ꍏꉸꏓꂱꇭꉼꇩ)' Key being added: 'አማርኛ (ኢትዮጵያ)' "</PRE>
<P>The <A href="http://metawrap.set-top.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/blog/EditEntryBox.ascx.cs?rev=1.1&view=log">code</A> asssumes that the name of the culture is unique. I vaguely remember an article on changes to the way cultures work in .NET; those changes could be the reason this assumption is not longer valid.</P>
