<P>Earlier today I spent some time installing the beta3-version of VSTS on a VPC-image. The entire experience reminded me of first few Biztalk 2004 installs I did: you come very close to finishing the installing, but it fails on the last step.</P>
<P>Some at Microsoft must have felt the pain this was causing. At <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/">MSDN-subscriber downloads</A> there is a VPC-image available that contains the entire thing: Windows Server 2003, SQL Server and VSTS. At more than 2 gigabytes the download is sizeable but avoiding having to install all the different items makes it well worth the wait. It unpacks to about 9Gb.</P>
<P>If you intend to dive into all the VSTS-goodness Microsoft has been showing, you should seriously consider <STRIKE>avoiding a manual installation</STRIKE> downloading this.</P>
